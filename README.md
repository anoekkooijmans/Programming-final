# The HDI and the prevelance of mental health disorders

The Final-assignment notebook contains an EDA (exploratory data analysis) performed on the Human Development Index (HDI) and prevelance of mental health disorders globally. This analysis aims to investigate whether there is a relationship between the HDI and the prevalence of mental disorders. The relationship is determined using polynomial regression analysis and correlation analysis with Spearman's correlation coefficient.
