    "The aim of this analysis is to investigate the relationship between country-level socioeconomic status and the prevalence of mental health disorders. Studies have suggested that mental health is worse is relatively highly developed countries [(Barbalat & Franck, 2020)](https://bmjopen.bmj.com/content/bmjopen/10/4/e035055.full.pdf). A country's level of human development can be measured using the humand development index (HDI).\n",
    "\n",
    "The HDI is a metric designed to quantify a country's socieeconomic status by using key dimensions of human development. The index is calculated using four key metrics: (1) life expectancy at birth - to asses a long and healthy life, (2) expected years of schooling - to asses access to knowledge of the younger generation, (3) average years of schooling - to assess access to knowledge of the older generation and (4) gross national income (GNI) per capita - to asses the standard of living. Each of these metrics is normalized to an index value and aggregated into the HDI using the following formula [(2020 HDR Technical Notes)](https://hdr.undp.org/system/files/documents/technical-notes-calculating-human-development-indices.pdf):\n",
    "\n",
    "$HDI = (I_{Health} * I_{Education} * I_{Income})^\\frac{1}{3}$\n",
